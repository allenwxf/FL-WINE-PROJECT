2018-09-09 01:26:10,871 - root - WARNING - exception when at https://translate.google.cn/translate_a/single?client=t&sl=en&tl=zh&hl=de&dt=at&dt=bd&dt=ex&dt=ld&dt=md&dt=qca&dt=rw&dt=rm&dt=ss&dt=t&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&otf=1&ssel=3&tsel=0&kc=1&tk=579534.939247&q=Clos Apalta continues to push the envelope for Chilean icon wines. It's always been a blend of four or five Bordeaux grapes, and the 2005 is every bit as structured, tight and ripe as any predecessor. There is an intense blanket of new oak that tastes of mint, cinnamon, sawdust and black licorice. When that subsides (maybe in another 12 months), expect racy and complex berry flavors, pinpoint tannins and preserving acidity. Hold for another two years; then drink through 2014. :SOCKSHTTPSConnectionPool(host='translate.google.cn', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=4)

While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023. :SOCKSHTTPSConnectionPool(host='translate.google.cn', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=4)
