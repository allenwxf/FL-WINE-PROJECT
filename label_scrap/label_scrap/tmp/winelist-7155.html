A critical reason for the success of this wine, and every wine they make, has always been that they create the final blend before aging it in American oak barrels and then bottles.

From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978 to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.&nbsp;\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fundamental to this tradition was the early, pioneering decision by Duckhorn Vineyards to focus on the production of Merlot. Though many Napa Valley wineries were using Merlot as a blending grape in the late seventies, few were exploring the potential of this varietal as a standalone wine. A great fan of Merlot since traveling to St. Emilion and Pomerol, Dan Duckhorn felt that this elegant varietal was underappreciated in North America. “I liked the softness, the seductiveness, the color,” says Dan, “the fact that it went with a lot of different foods; it wasn't so bold, didn't need to age so long, and it had this velvety texture to it. It seemed to me to be a wonderful wine to just enjoy. I became enchanted with Merlot.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dan also believed that the American palate was undergoing a gradual but dramatic shift, moving away from jug producers toward quality varietal wine. This conviction made the timing perfect for the introduction of Duckhorn Vineyards’ Napa Valley Merlot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The quality of Duckhorn Vineyards wines has always been based on a commitment to selecting the finest fruit. Whether carefully sourcing grapes from top sites in the Napa Valley or committing itself to establishing a world-class estate vineyard program, the winery was built on the belief that great wines begin in the vineyard. At Duckhorn Vineyards this has always meant an emphasis on site and terroir. Beginning in 1988, hand-selected Napa Valley properties were purchased for the estate vineyard program, guaranteeing a consistent source of high quality fruit, year after year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Today, the winery’s seven estate vineyards are located in alluvial fans of the Napa Valley and on the coveted slopes of Howell Mountain. The shallow and rocky alluvial soil drains easily, forcing the vines to send roots deep in search of water. The rocks retain the day’s heat, bringing relief to the vines during cold spring mornings and foggy summer nights. Because of its topography, soils, and climate, Howell Mountain has distinctly different grapegrowing conditions than the valley floor. Often during summer months, the maritime fog seeping into the Napa Valley below will not reach the mountaintop, giving more sunlight and moderate temperatures. As a result, winemaker Renee Ary has numerous vineyard blocks to choose from, each offering markedly different flavor profiles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For nearly four decades, the commitment to crafting wines of distinction has remained at the heart of the Duckhorn Vineyards philosophy. As its Napa Valley estate properties continue to mature under Renee’s stewardship, the winery will continue creating world-class wines from exceptional vineyards.&nbsp;\u003c/p>","region":"California","imageUrl":"19.jpg","geoLat":38.529416,"geoLong":-122.490612,"refinementId":8808},"vineyardId":19,"vintage":"2015","volume":750,"warehouseCutoffTime":"13:00:00"},"productMediaModel":{"associated_entity_id":"406915","entity_type_id":"published-products-www","count_medias":2,"medias":[{"media_type_id":"front-label","base_url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/winecom/image/upload/","public_id":"406915","height":1000,"width":1000,"priority_order":1,"alt_text":"Flat front label of wine","title":null,"credit":null,"description":null},{"media_type_id":"front-bottle-shot","base_url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/winecom/image/upload/","public_id":"406915fbs","height":2000,"width":807,"priority_order":2,"alt_text":"Front shot of wine bottle","title":null,"credit":null,"description":null}]}},{"productTemplateId":97450,"vineyardId":306,"includeObjects":["averageRatingModel","catalogModel","productMediaModel"],"sourceModel":"catalogModel","cartId":"","destination":"","displayActivityDate":"","listName":"","listId":"","productId":"MAH97450_2005","userProfileId":"","productMediaType":"published-products-www","wineryMediaType":"wineries-published","averageRatingModel":{"itemReviewed":97450,"ratingsAverage":4.3,"ratingsCount":23,"ratingsAverageDisplay":"4.3"},"catalogModel":{"appellationId":12114,"appellation":"Pauillac","origin":"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France","containsAlcohol":true,"fullName":"Chateau Latour 2005","hasFluid":false,"hasFluid360":false,"hasFluidGiftThumbs":false,"hasLabel":true,"hasLargeLabel":true,"hasSubstitute":false,"hoursLeft":10,"id":"MAH97450_2005","isPreSale":false,"isReference":false,"longDescription":"Ex-Chateau Release\u003cp>The 2005 vintage demonstrates the superiority of the Cabernet Sauvignon which alone brings body, power, fruit, and structure.

He was joined at the head of the House in 1798 by his son, François Clicquot, who had recently married Barbe Ponsardin.

She demonstrated her innovative spirit in 1810 by producing the first vintage wine in Champagne. In 1816, she invented the riddling table as a way to clarify her champagne, and by doing so, she improved both the quality and finesse of the wines. Never one to rest on her laurels, in 1818 Madame Clicquot created the first rose champagne made through assemblage, a method where white wines are blended with red wines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Faithful to the values of creativity and innovation passed on by Madame Clicquot, the Maison marked its bottles with its first yellow label in 1877, making the brand distinctive and instantly recognizable.
